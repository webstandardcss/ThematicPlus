*** Thematic Plus ***

Really should be Thematic Minus because I removed most presentational styling to provide more of a blank slate. This reduces the need to override a lot of CSS styles to get the colors, backgrounds, and borders removed or changed. It allows you to use less specific CSS to get the job done.

*** Instructions ***

Install Thematic Theme Framework from the WordPress plugin repository.

Install this zip from the WordPress admin: "appearance -> themes" or unzip into your wp-content/themes directory.

Activate ThematicPlus

*** IMPORTANT ***  

Only edit custom.css and functions.php to reduce problems when Thematic is upgraded.

*** PROTIP *** 

Make a site-helper plugin instead of editing functions.php to use your code with any theme.

*** TODO *** 

Make this multi-site enabled just like the LessThematic child theme on GitHub.
